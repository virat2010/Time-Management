# Time-Management
**My Time Management Project.**
***
#### This is project is entirely dedicated to my _TiManager_ project.

This was inspired from a reading project that I made. The project was made to help busy people or any people in general with time management in ways that no one has seen before.

My Ten Methods:
* Pomodoro Technique
* Eisenhower Technique
* SMART Goals
* Eat That Frog! _(Yeah, really...)_
* Pareto Principle
* Getting Things Done
* Ivy Lee Method
* Time Blocking
* Seinfeld Method
* 10-Minute Rule
