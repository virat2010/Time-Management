# Time-Management
**My Time Management Project.**
***

### This is project is entirely dedicated to my *TiManager* project.

---
This was inspired from a reading project that I made. The project was made to help busy people or any people in general with time management in ways that no one has seen before.

My Ten Methods:
* Pomodoro Technique
* Eisenhower Technique
* SMART Goals
* Eat That Frog! *(Yeah, really...)*
* Pareto Principle
* Getting Things Done
* Ivy Lee Method
* Time Blocking
* Seinfeld Method
* 10-Minute Rule

## Pomodoro Technique

1. Create a general plan of what to do for the day


2. Break up into 25-minute intervals. Take 5-minute Breaks


3. Every 3 or 4 Cycles take a longer break of 15 or 20 Minutes

## Eisenhower Technique

1. Break tasks into quadrants. Importance and Urgency


2. Delegate Urgent but Unimportant tasks to others


3. Get rid of Urgent and Unimportant tasks


4. Do most Urgent and Important tasks


5. Plan least Urgent but Important tasks

## SMART Goals

1. S, Set Specific Goals


2. M, Set Measurable Goals


3. A, Set Achievable Goals


4. R, Set Relevant Goals


5. T, Set Timed Goals

## Eat That Frog!

1. Find the most important task of your day

2. Put it at the top of your schedule

3. Complete the remaining minor tasks after important ones

4. It takes time to get used to it!

## Pareto Principle

1. 80% of the output comes from 20% of the effort

2. Make sure to do tasks with most output first

3. Remove most other tasks slowing your tasks

## Getting Things Done

1. Record all your tasks is a collection tool

2. Clarify each task to see what catches the most attention

3. Organize all your tasks and reminders in one place

4. Frequently review if you achieved the task, think how to better next time

5. Use to make decisions more confidently with more calrity

## Ivy Lee Method

1. Create 6 important tasks for one day

2. Finish them all one by one

3. Push unfinished tasks for next day

4. Repeat every day

## Time Blocking

1. Create a minute-by-minute schdeuly of your whole week

2. Adjust timings accordingly with new tasks and changing times throughout the week

3. At the end of the week, repeat

## Seinfeld Method

1. Choose a specific task that you will do regurarly

2. Create a big calendar of the year

3. As you do it day after day take a red marker and mark the day

4. Not breaking the chain will be motivating.

## 10-Minute Rule

1. Every task should take 10 minutes

2. If it doesn't you should've broken it into smaller tasks

3. If it doesn't, there's a chance you should've delegated it
